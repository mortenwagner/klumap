What worked and what failed?\n3. What specific patterns of success or failure emerged across these analogies?\n4. How should I adapt these learnings to my specific context? What translates directly vs. what needs adjustment?\n5. Which analogy is the strongest predictor for my assumption, and why?"

(Past technology shifts, market transitions, regulatory changes.)\n4. What patterns emerge when I look across multiple analogies? What's common across successes? Across failures?\n5.

What specifically makes my context genuinely different from the analogies I might find?\n4. When do analogies actively mislead rather than inform? What are the warning signs?\n5. How might the best analogies for my assumption be ones I'd never think to look for — in domains completely unlike mine?"
