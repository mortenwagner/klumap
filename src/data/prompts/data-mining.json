What public data sources could directly or indirectly address this assumption? (Government statistics, industry reports, academic research, app store data, social media analytics.)\n2. What specific metrics or data points should I look for? What numbers would validate this assumption vs. invalidate it?\n3. How confident can I be in secondary data for this type of assumption? What are the limits?\n4. What search queries and databases should I use to find this data efficiently?\n5. If the data exists, how do I interpret it?

How might the market I'm entering differ from what aggregate data suggests? (Local vs. global, niche vs. mainstream, timing differences.)\n4. When does relying on secondary data become a substitute for actually talking to customers? Am I using data mining as an avoidance strategy?\n5.
