What specific user behaviors should I observe during the test? (Not just satisfaction — what actions reveal true value?)\n4. At what point, if ever, should I reveal that it was manual?

Which one should I start with?\n2. If I ran a manual version for one week, what would I learn about how users actually interact with the solution?\n3. What would the experience teach me about operational requirements that I can't predict from the outside?\n4. What scaling indicators should I watch for — signs that the solution could work at scale vs. signs it only works with my personal attention?\n5.

How might the manual approach give me false confidence? (Founder attention, cherry-picked users, unsustainable quality.)\n4. When does a Wizard of Oz test actively mislead founders? What are the warning signs?\n5. What alternative testing method would give me more reliable evidence for this specific assumption?"
