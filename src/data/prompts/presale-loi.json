Tiered?)\n3. What commitment format is appropriate — letter of intent, refundable deposit, pre-order, or contract? What does each prove?\n4. How many commitments would validate this assumption? What number or conversion rate would be a kill signal?\n5. What should I do when someone says no — how do I extract maximum learning from rejections?"

How could I test different pricing tiers within the pre-sale to learn about willingness-to-pay?\n3. Who should I approach first? What makes someone an ideal pre-sale candidate vs. a misleading one?\n4. How can I use the negotiation process itself as research? What do objections, hesitations, and conditions teach me?\n5.

How does selection bias in early adopters mislead me? (Early adopters aren't representative of the mainstream market.)\n4. How can pre-sale pricing send false signals? (People who buy at a discount may not buy at full price.)\n5. What assumptions am I NOT testing by running a pre-sale? What risks remain even if people commit?"
