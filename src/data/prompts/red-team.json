What's the single strongest argument that this assumption is wrong? Build the full case.\n2. What evidence would you demand before believing this assumption? Be specific.\n3. What similar assumptions have you seen other founders make that led to failure? What's the pattern?\n4. What's the 'uncomfortable question' the founding team is probably avoiding about this assumption?\n5. If you had to bet AGAINST this assumption, what would be your strategy and your timeline?"

What's stopping me? What would I use instead?\n2. **The Ruthless Competitor**: How would I crush this startup? What's their weakest point?\n3. **The Experienced VC**: What pattern am I seeing here that usually ends badly? What's the 'real risk' the founders haven't identified?\n4. **The Domain Expert**: What do outsiders to this industry always get wrong? What does the team not know that they don't know?\n5. **The Operations Realist**: What will break first when this hits the real world? What looks great on a slide deck but falls apart in practice?\n\nFor each perspective, give me the hardest question they would ask and the action I should take in response."
