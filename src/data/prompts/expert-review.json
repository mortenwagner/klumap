What questions should I ask that experts typically won't volunteer on their own? What uncomfortable truths should I probe for?\n4. What blind spots do experts typically have?

What patterns led to those failures?\n4. How might expert advice lead me to over-engineer, over-plan, or miss the real risk entirely?\n5. What would I learn from non-experts (actual customers, complete outsiders) that experts cannot tell me?"
