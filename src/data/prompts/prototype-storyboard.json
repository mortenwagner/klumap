How should my testing protocol differ based on the format I choose?\n3. What would a storyboard of the user journey reveal that a static prototype can't?\n4. How do I separate 'polite interest' from genuine excitement? What signals am I really looking for?\n5. What sequence of prototype tests would give me the most learning — what should I test first, second, third?\n6.

What can prototypes fundamentally NOT test about this assumption? (Habit formation, willingness to pay, real-world switching costs.)\n4. What is the 'build trap' — how do founders use prototyping as an excuse to keep designing instead of testing with real stakes?\n5. What alternative approach would give me higher-fidelity evidence for this assumption?"
